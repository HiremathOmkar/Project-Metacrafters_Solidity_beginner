About
This contract represents a custom ERC-20 token named Clock (Clk). The contract allows users to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens under certain conditions. The contract's purpose is to showcase the implementation of basic token functionalities.

The contract has the following public variables:

tokenName: A string representing the name of the token.
tokenAbb: A string representing the token's abbreviation.
totalSupply: An unsigned integer representing the total supply of the token.
It also uses a mapping named balance to associate addresses with their token balances.

Functions
mint(address _address, uint _value): This function allows minting new tokens. It takes an address and a value as parameters and increases the total supply by the given value. The balance of the specified address is also increased by the given value.

burn(address _address, uint _value): This function allows burning tokens. It takes an address and a value as parameters and decreases the total supply by the given value if the balance of the specified address is greater than or equal to the value. The balance of the address is also reduced by the given value.

Usage
To use this contract, you need to deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain. After deployment, you can interact with the contract by calling its functions:

Call the mint function to mint new tokens for a specific address.
Call the burn function to burn existing tokens for a specific address.
